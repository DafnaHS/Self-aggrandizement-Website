<h2>What is self-aggrandizement?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Self-aggrandizement is the act of making oneself more powerful, wealthy, and other things, in a ruthless way. Self-aggrandizement is a colloquial term that broadly describes Narcissism, the most defining trait of people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It differs from general boasting, which most of us indulge in now and then, in that it can often manifest in aggressive, ruthless, or manipulative patterns of relating. The opposite of self-aggrandizement is self-deprecating which is is the act of reprimanding oneself by belittling, undervaluing, or disparaging oneself, or being excessively modest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Some psychologists believe that Narcissists are people whose emotional centers have fewer connections to the higher reasoning parts of the brain located in the frontal cortex - so they lack that filter most of us use to keep our basic instincts in check. Despite their facade, self-aggrandizers often suffer from low self-esteem themselves. They live in a dog-eat-dog world of fear where being anything less than being number one is regarded as a failure &ndash; a world where nobody can be trusted.</span></p>
